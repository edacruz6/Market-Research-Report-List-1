<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hinged Expansion Joints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flange Type</li><li>Welding Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Hinged Expansion Joints market primarily features two types: Flange Type and Welding Type. Flange Type joints utilize flanges for easy installation and maintenance, offering flexibility and accommodating movement in piping systems. They are ideal for applications requiring disassembly. Conversely, Welding Type joints are permanently welded into the piping system, providing stronger and more leak-resistant connections. They are suitable for high-pressure applications but lack the ease of disassembly. Both types are critical for managing thermal expansion and contraction in industrial applications.</p></p>
