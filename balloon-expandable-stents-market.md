<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balloon-expandable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stents</li><li>Drug-eluting Stents</li><li>Bioabsorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The balloon-expandable stents market comprises three main types. Bare-metal stents are constructed from stainless steel or cobalt-chromium alloys and offer structural support but lack therapeutic agents. Drug-eluting stents are coated with medication to prevent restenosis, delivering drugs directly to the arterial wall. Bioabsorbable stents, designed to dissolve over time, provide temporary support while allowing natural healing, minimizing long-term complications. Each type addresses specific patient needs, influencing market dynamics and adoption rates in the cardiovascular treatment landscape.</p></p>
