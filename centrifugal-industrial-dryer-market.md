<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Industrial Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct</li><li>Indirect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal industrial dryers come in two main types: direct and indirect. Direct centrifugal dryers operate by directly exposing the material to a heated air stream, facilitating rapid moisture removal. This method is efficient for drying various substances but may risk thermal degradation. In contrast, indirect centrifugal dryers use heated surfaces to transfer heat to the material without direct contact with the drying medium, making them suitable for heat-sensitive materials. Both types cater to different industrial drying needs based on material properties and process requirements.</p></p>
