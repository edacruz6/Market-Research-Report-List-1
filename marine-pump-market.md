<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Displacement Pump</li><li>Roto-Dynamic Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine pump market is primarily categorized into two types: positive displacement pumps and roto-dynamic pumps. Positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed amount of fluid and forcing it out, making them ideal for high-viscosity liquids and precise flow control. In contrast, roto-dynamic pumps function by imparting kinetic energy to the fluid through rotational motion, making them suitable for high flow rates and low-viscosity fluids. Both types serve critical roles in marine applications, enhancing efficiency and reliability in fluid transport.</p></p>
