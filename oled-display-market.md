<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The OLED Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode(AMOLED Display)</li><li>Passive Matrix OLED(PMOLED)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The OLED display market comprises two main types: Active-Matrix OLED (AMOLED) and Passive Matrix OLED (PMOLED). AMOLED displays utilize a thin-film transistor array to control individual pixels, allowing for higher resolution and faster refresh rates, making them ideal for smartphones and televisions. In contrast, PMOLED displays employ a simpler architecture where entire rows or columns are activated sequentially, resulting in lower production costs but limited resolution and refresh rates. PMOLED is typically used in smaller screens, like wearables and simple displays.</p></p>
