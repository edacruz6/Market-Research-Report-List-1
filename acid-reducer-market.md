<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acid Reducer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Histamine Antagonists</li><li>Proton Pump Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The acid reducer market comprises two main types: histamine antagonists and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Histamine antagonists, such as ranitidine and famotidine, work by blocking histamine receptors in the stomach, reducing acid production and alleviating symptoms of conditions like GERD. Proton pump inhibitors, including omeprazole and esomeprazole, inhibit the proton pump in gastric cells, resulting in a more potent and longer-lasting reduction of stomach acid. Both types are widely used for treating acid-related disorders and promoting digestive health.</p></p>
